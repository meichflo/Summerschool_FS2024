    "<p>The term 'credit risk' refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the owed principal and interest. The principal is the amount a consumer borrowed and have to pay back. Interest is what the lender charges for lending the money. The credit risk of a borrower can be measured by the five Cs (see: <a>https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Five_Cs_Of_Credit_Analysis</a>): capacity, capital, character, colletaral, conditions. Based on this information a credit score can be calculated for every consumer. A credit score is one indicator that lenders use to asses how likely it is that a borrower is to default. To compensate for the credit risk, consumers with lower credit scores are usually charged higher interest rates on loans than consumers with higher credit scores.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The agent-based model (ABM) provided in this Jupyter notebook is used to explore the role of different parameters like the number of agents and loan term on the credit risk. It contains a Lender class, a Borrower class and a CreditModel class. The model contains different time steps corresponding to the number of month in which the loan must be repayed (the loan term). The model also contains different borrower agents. Each borrower has a credit score ranging from 50 to 100. The interest rate depends on the credit risk score. If the credit risk score is high, the interest rate is low and vice versa.</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>At the beginning, each borrower asks for a random amount of money (the principle) between 50,000 and 500,000 USD. The model steps correspond to the number of months in which the loan must be repayed. At each model step, the borrower must repay the monthly loan. As in practise, the monthly payment remains the same throughout the loan term, but the allocation between principal and interest changes over time. At the beginning, a larger portion of the payment goes towards interest, while towards the end, a larger portion goes towards the principal. Sometimes a borrower cannot repay the monthly loan. If this happens, the borrower must repay the monthly rate owed in the next model step. If a borrower cannot repay the loan for three consecutive months, this borrower is removed from the model, and the remaining loan is considered as defaulted.</p>"
